    "- Search engines allow you to index documents, enabling users to search and explore content through features such as highlights or facets.\n",
    "- The inverted index is the mechanical heart of the search engine.\n",
    "- Additional data structures and statistics support the inverted index in enabling users to match and explore content.\n",
    "- The inverted index is dumb and respects only exact byte-for-byte term matches when searched.\n",
    "- Analysis allows you to normalize tokens to common representations, to overcome the basic matching ability of the inverted index by using character filters, a tokenizer, and token filters.\n",
    "- Analysis enables you to express important features of your search as tokens.\n",
    "- Boolean search is a rather basic application of the inverted index data structure.\n",
    "- Relevance results are controlled by a ranking function and based on numerous statistics such as term frequency and document frequency.\n",
    "- You have the ultimate power to control matching through analysis (covered in chapter 4) and to control the ranking function (covered in chapters 5â€“7)!"
